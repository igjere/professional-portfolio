<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Currently I am working for <a href="https://www.sbdcnet.org/" target="_blank"><i>SBDCNet</i></a>, aiding small businesses anywhere in the US by answering their questions with responses of researched information I collected myself. My <b>dream job</b> doesn't have a particular company name attached to it yet but as far as circumstances go, I'd prefer something remote and with enough compensation to live a comfortable life.</p>

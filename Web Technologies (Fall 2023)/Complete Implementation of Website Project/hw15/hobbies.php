<p>My hobbies (in decreasing order of time spent doing them) are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spending time with my friends and cat</li>
<li>Gaming</li> 
<li>Maintaining my fitness by going to the gym</li> 
</ol>
<p>For gaming, I prefer fighting games. For going to the gym, I have been maintaining a schedule with varying levels of consistency for about 3 years. My cats name is SPY. Check out this photo of him:</p>
